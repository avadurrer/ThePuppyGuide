  <p>Retroist Rubrik: *First 5 minutes*
(Connection noises) The story you are about to hear is proof, “Attention! all troops!” (Retro Noises occuring). It's alive, Alive! ( retro noises) Welcome to the retroist. I made a lot of bad bets with my friends as a kid, things like, can you pick this lock? Can you beat this video game? One of the ones I regret most is can you solve this rubik's cube? The stakes were high. This is when we were really getting into our commodore machines and we bet a bunch of floppy disks. When I made this bet, I thought I could go to the library and really figure out how to solve a cube but after spending two hours, maybe three sitting in the library turning that cube and trying to get it right, I couldn't figure it out. Put the book down and discussed and realized I was going to lose a box of floppy disks. Then, a dark thought crossed my mind. Perhaps, I wasn't going to lose a box of floppy disks. Perhaps I could solve the cube in a more unconventional way. That's right! I decided  I was going to do one of two things. I was going to take my rubik's cube apart or I was going to take the stickers off and reapply them. At first glance I thought the sticker thing might be easier but then it occurred that maybe they would lose their stickability and I wouldn't be able to put them back on. So then I went home, got a screwdriver, and started trying to pry the rubik's cube apart. Now, since then I have learned to properly take a rubik's cube apart. You sort of give it a quarter turn then you can pop the pieces off. Back then, I started to just take the cube and jab the screwdriver at the center cube which I thought wasn't attached to the base and soon it wouldn't be and i pryed upward and the center pierced popped into the air! I busted my rubik's cube in an attempt to score some floppy disks. The real weird thing about this is I decided not to bring it up to my friends and they didn't either so the bet itself went nowhere which is often the case with our bets. You take them seriously and people kind of forget about them when something else would happen but I had a constant reminder. My busted rubik's cube. It would be a few years before I was able to pick another one up at a garage sale and I would work on that one failing most of the time until I finally figured it out and now can solve a rubik's cube without breaking it or removing the stickers. I don't know why i was so fascinated with the rubik's cube but i always have been, maybe its the puzzle, maybe its the colors, maybe its the cartoon i was obsessed with during its reform but on today's show, were going to talk about the cartoon “rubrick, the amazing cube” i'll talk about the people behind the camera, people doing the voices, the plot, the shows all too brief run, the theme song and where you can find the “rubik the amazing cube” today. We have an infopacked episode ahead of us, so without further ado, let's start the show. (Retro Music playing). “Rubik the amazing cube” ran from september of 1983 to september of 1984 and it was produced by ruby spears. It was on tv as part of the pacman, rubik the amazing cube hour on abc. Ruby spears, the creators of the show is a california based production company that specializes in animation. It was founded in 1977 by Jorebie and Ken spears. They had both started out as sound editors at Hannah Barbera and eventually would start writing stories on shows like “herculoids” and “space ghosts.” In the late 60s, they were tasked with developing a cartoon for Saturday morning that was  matter based. The end result would be the iconic scooby doo where are you. Eventually, they would depart from hannah barbera.
