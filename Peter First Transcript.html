  <p>Peter First Transcript: *First 5 minutes*
My dear children, young and old. 
      Each character of this tale is represented by an instrument in the orchestra. 
      The bird, by a flute (Flute playing).
      The duck by an oboe (Oboe playing). 
      The cat, by a clarinet, in a low register (Clarinet playing). 
      The grandfather, by a bassoon (Bassoon playing).
      The warp by a horn (Horn playing).
      Peter by the string instruments (string instruments playing).
      The shooting of the hunters by kettle drums (Kettle drums playing).
      And now dear children, here is our story. 
      Early one morning, Peter opened the gate and went out into the big green meadow (Musical orchestra playing).
      On the branch of a big tree sat a little bird, Peter's friend “all is quiet” chirped the little bird daily (Bird chirping)(Orchestra begins to play after the birds stop chirping). 
      Soon, a duck came waddling around, she was glad that Peter did not close the gate and decided to have a nice swim in the deep pond in the meadow (Orchestra playing).
      When the little bird saw the duck, he flew down, settled himself in the grass beside the duck and shrugged his shoulders (Orchestra playing).</p>
