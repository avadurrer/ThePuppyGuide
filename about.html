      Hey dog-loving friends! My journey with dogs began with Harley <br>
      when I was just 3 years old. Harley was a dachshund, but to me, <br>
      he was so much more than that. Harley was my best friend, and we <br>
      basically grew up together. Whenever I was having a bad day, he
      was there,<br>
      &nbsp;and whenever I was having a good day, he was there to make
      it even better.<br>
      &nbsp;Now, my family is a three-dog party with Gus, the black lab,
      and the dynamic<br>
      &nbsp;duo, Artie and Gitlow, the yorkies. Dogs have filled my life
      with joy since I <br>
      can remember, and through The Puppy Guide, I hope to spread that
      joy to you guys. <br>
      Join me in celebrating the incredible bond between humans and
      their furry best friends! <br>
